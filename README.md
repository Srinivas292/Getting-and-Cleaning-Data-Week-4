# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Week-4

### Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

This repo was created to finish the assignment for week 4 of Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.
* First, download and unzip the data file into your R working directory.
* Second, download the R source code into your R working directory.
* Finally, execute R source code to generate tidy data file.

### Data description
The variables in the data X are sensor signals measured with waist-mounted smartphone from 30 subjects. The variable in the data Y indicates activity type the subjects performed during recording.

### Code explaination
The code combined training dataset and test dataset,  and extracted partial variables to create another dataset with the averages of each variable for each activity.

### New dataset
The new generated dataset contained variables calculated based on the mean and standard deviation. Each row of the dataset is an average of each activity type for all subjects.

### The code was written based on the instruction of this assignment
Read training and test dataset into R environment.
Read variable names into R envrionment.
Read subject index into R environment.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Use command rbind to combine training and test set
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Use grep command to get column indexes for variable name contains "mean()" or "std()"
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Convert activity labels to characters and add a new column as factor
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
Give the selected descriptive names to variable columns
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
Use pipeline command to create a new tidy dataset with command group_by and summarize_each in dplyr package
